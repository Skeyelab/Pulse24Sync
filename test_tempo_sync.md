# Testing Tempo Synchronization Fix

## Test Procedure

To verify that the tempo synchronization fix is working correctly, follow these steps:

### 1. Load the Plugin
- Open your DAW (e.g., Reaper, Bitwig, Ableton, FL Studio)
- Add the Pulse24Sync VST3 plugin to a track
- The plugin should be located in `~/.vst3/Pulse24Sync.vst3`

### 2. Enable Host Sync
- In the plugin UI, ensure "Sync to Host Tempo" is enabled (should be enabled by default)
- The status should show "Host Sync - [current BPM] BPM"

### 3. Test Tempo Changes
1. **Initial Tempo Test**:
   - Set DAW tempo to 120 BPM
   - Start playback
   - Verify pulses are generated at correct rate (48 Hz for 120 BPM)
   - The status should show "Host Sync - 120.0 BPM | Rate: 48.0 Hz"

2. **Tempo Change Test**:
   - While playing, change DAW tempo to 140 BPM
   - Pulses should immediately adjust to new rate (56 Hz for 140 BPM)
   - The status should update to "Host Sync - 140.0 BPM | Rate: 56.0 Hz"
   
3. **Slow Tempo Test**:
   - Change tempo to 60 BPM
   - Verify pulses slow down accordingly (24 Hz for 60 BPM)
   - Status: "Host Sync - 60.0 BPM | Rate: 24.0 Hz"

4. **Fast Tempo Test**:
   - Change tempo to 180 BPM
   - Verify pulses speed up (72 Hz for 180 BPM)
   - Status: "Host Sync - 180.0 BPM | Rate: 72.0 Hz"

### 4. Test Tempo Automation
- Create a tempo automation curve in your DAW
- Play through the automation
- Verify pulses follow tempo changes smoothly

### 5. Test Transport Repositioning
- Start playback at one tempo
- Stop and reposition the playhead
- Start playback again
- Verify pulses resync correctly to the new position

## Expected Results

✅ **Working Correctly If**:
- Pulse rate changes immediately when DAW tempo changes
- No glitches or dropouts during tempo changes
- Pulse timing stays locked to DAW's beat grid
- Status display updates to show current BPM
- Calculated pulse rate matches formula: Rate (Hz) = BPM × 24 / 60

## Technical Details

The fix implements:
1. **PPQ-based timing**: Uses DAW's PPQ (Pulses Per Quarter) position for accurate sync
2. **Tempo change detection**: Detects when tempo changes > 0.1 BPM
3. **Automatic resync**: Resets timing when tempo changes or transport jumps
4. **Correct formula**: Fixed calculation (was multiplying by 4, now correctly calculates 24 PPQN)

## Pulse Rate Formula
```
Pulse Rate (Hz) = (BPM / 60) × 24
```

Examples:
- 60 BPM → 24 Hz
- 120 BPM → 48 Hz
- 140 BPM → 56 Hz
- 180 BPM → 72 Hz
