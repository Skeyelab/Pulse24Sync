# Acknowledgments

## Original Inspiration

This plugin was directly inspired by a Facebook post in the **Synthesizer Zone** group by **Zac Caruso**:

> "Anyone know of a plugin that can do 24 pulses per quarter note and stay in time with tempo changes? I'd actually pay someone to"

This request highlighted a specific gap in the music production toolset - the need for precise, tempo-synchronized pulse generation that can adapt to real-time tempo changes. The fact that someone was willing to pay for this functionality demonstrated a real need in the community.

## Community Context

The **Synthesizer Zone** Facebook group is a vibrant community of synthesizer enthusiasts, producers, and developers who share knowledge, techniques, and creative ideas. This plugin is a direct response to a community need identified through their discussions.

## Use Case Validation

Zac's request for 24 pulses per quarter note suggests several potential applications:

- **High-resolution rhythmic modulation** for synthesizer parameters
- **Precise clock generation** for modular systems requiring fine timing control
- **Tempo-synced effects processing** with micro-rhythmic precision
- **Experimental music composition** exploring subdivisions beyond standard musical notation
- **Sequencer synchronization** for systems requiring high-resolution timing

## Technical Implementation

The plugin implements Zac's exact specification:
- ✅ **24 pulses per quarter note** - Exactly 24 evenly spaced pulses
- ✅ **Tempo synchronization** - Automatically adapts to host tempo changes
- ✅ **Real-time operation** - No latency or timing drift
- ✅ **Cross-platform compatibility** - Works on macOS and Windows

## Open Source Contribution

This plugin is released as open source to give back to the community that inspired it. The hope is that it will be useful to other producers and developers who have similar needs.
